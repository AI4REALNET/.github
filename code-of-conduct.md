## Code Of Conduct
### AI4REALNET - AI for REAL-world NETwork operation

</div>

As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, without exceptions. We are committed to fostering an environment where all individuals feel respected, valued, and safe to express their ideas and opinions.

## Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language. 
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. 
- Focusing on what is best for the community. 
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

**Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances. 
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment. 
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. 
- Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in which it occurs.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct is applicable in all project spaces. It extends to situations where an individual represents the project or its community in public forums. Representation includes:
- Using an official project email address.
- Posting from official social media accounts.
- Serving as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

Project maintainers may elaborate on the specifics of project representation.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are tasked with defining acceptable behavior standards. They must respond to unacceptable behavior with appropriate and fair corrective action. 
They hold the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct. They also reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Violations

Code of Conduct violations can be reported to the designated Organization Stewards (contacts available on the [Organization Main Page](https://github.com/AI4REALNET)). The Organization Stewards will review the report, determine if a violation occurred, and administer appropriate sanctions, including warnings or expulsion from project-related spaces or forums. 
The following information should be included in your report:

- Contact (email).
- Name (real name, nickname, or pseudonym) of individuals involved or witnesses.
- Files or links to additional available records relevant to the analysis.

Organization Stewards will then analyze the information and contact you with more details.
Code of Conduct violations can arise in any context, including project-related activities. Complaints regarding conduct are only considered if the reported incident occurred within the past year.

## Conflict Resolution

In case of conflicts or disputes arising within the project community, we encourage all parties to seek resolution through peaceful and constructive dialogue. Resolving disputes respectfully and respectfully is essential for maintaining a positive and productive environment for all community members.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders (project maintainers, administrators, and other designated representatives) have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when necessary.
